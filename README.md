# TensorFlow Model Training

## Description

**TensorFlow Model Training** is a repository that demonstrates the process of training machine learning models using TensorFlow. It includes code examples and templates for building, training, and evaluating models for a variety of tasks such as image classification, natural language processing, and regression analysis.

This project is designed for developers and data scientists looking to learn or enhance their skills in using TensorFlow for machine learning tasks.

## Features

- **Model Development:**
  - Pre-built templates for common machine learning tasks.
  - Customizable neural network architectures.

- **Data Preparation:**
  - Scripts for data preprocessing using Pandas.
  - Support for loading datasets in CSV format.

- **Training:**
  - TensorFlow-based model training workflows.
  - Customizable training configurations and hyperparameters.

- **Visualization:**
  - Training history plots (accuracy and loss).

## Dataset

The dataset used in the project involves structured data, which is loaded and processed using Pandas. To use your dataset:
1. Prepare your data in CSV format.
2. I took the students data from kaggle.
3. Update the data loading scripts if necessary to match your dataset structure.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: Programming language for developing the models and scripts.
- **TensorFlow**: Framework for building and training deep learning models.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and preprocessing.
- **Matplotlib**: For visualizing training metrics.

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/muhammademanaftab/TensorFlow_ModelTraining.git
   ```
2. **Create a Virtual Environment (Optional):**
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate   # For Linux/Mac
   venv\Scripts\activate    # For Windows
   ```
3. **Install Dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

1. **Prepare the Data:**
   - Add your dataset in CSV format to the `data/` folder.
   - Modify the data loading scripts if necessary.

2. **Train a Model:**
   - Customize the model architecture and hyperparameters in the provided script (e.g., `train_model.py`).
   - Run the training script:
     ```bash
     python train_model.py
     ```

3. **Visualize Results:**
   - Check the output plots in the `results/` folder for training history metrics (accuracy and loss).

*Note:* This version of the project does not include explicit evaluation scripts but can be extended for evaluation.
